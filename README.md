SQL Server Calendar table
==================

This script drops and creates a Calendar table used for reporting purposes or any other utility need where you need a calendar table.

The load script loads all dates from 1/1/1900 to 12/31/2099.  It also heavily relies on a CLR library from [http://www.sqlsharp.com](http://www.sqlsharp.com "http://www.sqlsharp.com") to load the different date elements.
